# Easy_Topography
Functions that make your life easier to plot beautiful topographies. The main function to count on is called `topohelper.m`. Channel locations of the EGI net can be found in the `Locfile` folder. Requires `EEGLAB` to work (download EEGLAB, copy the path, and use the function `call_eeglab()` to activate EEGLAB).
